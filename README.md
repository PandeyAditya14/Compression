# Compression 
This is personal Repository to explore the field of compression and implement compression algorithms for 
- [ ] Text
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Video
- [ ] Miscellaneous

## Approach
For the first few days I indent to start educating myself on the theorotical aspects of compression and update this README regularly and then move on move on to the application phase.

At this moment the project is divided in 2 phases
1. Theorotical Concepts
2. Implementation

For Implementation I am intending to use C++ and maybe Java

## Scope
I intend to create a complete terminal based tool to compress various kinds file fomats and in future make Web Application based on this.

## Introduction To Data Compression
This is process of encoding the information in fewer bits than the orignal information allowing us to save resouces. Data compression can divided into two wide categories.
1. Lossy Compression
2. Lossless Compression

Lossless compression works by identifying the and eliminating [statistical redundancy](http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m5410/m5410lc1.html). Whereas In contrast to this Lossy compression works by removing less important information and constructing an approximation of the overall orignal data.

The design of decompression schemes deals with managing tradeoff among various factors such as degree of compression , computation resource and cost and data loss ( in case of Lossy ).
